## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
NovusCLI is a lite version of the full Novus package manager (Coming later this year) that allows users to start with a simple syntax, for their favorite APT package manager.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
Getting started for contributing to NovusCLI is very easy, you just need to follow the instructions below if you wish to build from source.

### Prerequisites
In order to start building NovusCLI, you are going to need to have Apple's developer tools installed or xcode for example. You can get those [here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

NovusCLI uses default Apple clang compiler so this is all you need, but getting MacPT is higly recommended.

### Installing

For installation NovusCLI makes it really easy:

* cd into the directory
* Run make 
* Run sudo make install
* Enjoy Novus commnad line edition!

This are all the steps that you need to follow to get NovusCLI running on your system!

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
NovusCLI has a memorable set of commands that will allow you to use it everyday as your syntax for MacPT:

* ```nvs search [query]``` - Searches for a package in your resporitories
* ```list```  - Lists all packages in your resporitories
* ```nvs install [package]``` - Installs a package 
* ```reinstall [package]``` - Reinstalls a package
* ``` remove [package]``` - Removes a package
* ```edit-sources``` - Opens the APT repo editor
* ```autoremove``` - Removes unneeded packages (orphans)
* ```update``` - Update the repo lists
* ```upgrade``` - Upgrade all packages
* ```clean``` - Clear the download cache
* ```help``` - Open a help page similar to this one
* ```about``` - View legal information

Using NovusCLI is a lot of fun, as you see, and it doesnt require you to use the "sudo" prefix.
